# PreExBuilder
This plugin allows you to create a shp from scratch to digitize the pre ex features, classify them according to type and extrapolate their respective dimensions. It also allows you to calculate the m2 to be excavated for each single feature.

# Generate PreEx shp

# Classified Features

- classifies the shp according to interpretation
	Linear, Pit, Posthole, Cremation, Grave, Structure, Spread, Unclear
